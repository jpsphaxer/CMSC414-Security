I chose EVP_aes_256_gcm as my encryption algorithm mostly because it AES 256 is named to be one of the more "secure" types of encryption,
 and also because it is authenticated, which was part of the project description. 

in my output when encrypting:
<256bytes encrypted AES key>||<16 bytes iv>||<16 bytes tag>||< rest of bytes of aes encryp text> 

I chose the design to be this way because it would facilitate the things I needed to retrieve to decrypt
256 bytes read would help me do the decryption using the private key, which would get me the aes key for decryption
16 bytes of iv also used for decryption
16 bytes TAG for authentication 
x num of bytes to decrypt to get the message.
